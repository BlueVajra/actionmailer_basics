# ActionMailer Basics

## Goal

The goal of this repository is to give students a place where they can learn about
ActionMailer. There will be no lecture on this material before the homework. Students
can use the [ActionMailer guide](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html)
to help them along. Students will bring questions to class the next day
that we can answer for them.

## Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository
1. Install gems using `bundle install`
1. Create and migrate the databases using `rake db:create:all db:migrate`
1. Run all of the specs using `rake spec` or `rspec`

## Assignment

Get all of the specs passing. If you get stuck, check out the `solutions` branch
to help you along. Bring your questions to class the next day.
